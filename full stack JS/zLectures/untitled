Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (Secure)
The rules for sending and receiving data on the internet.

url ip address has 4 sets of numbers separated by 3 periods
ie: 12.48.110.0   it will be between 0 and 250

Server is like the front desk person. just listening for the request
API is like a pharmasist.  It knows what you need and the rules for getting it
DATABASE is the like the shelves that hold all the medications

Client request to server, server takes request to API, API takes the data from the DATABASE and gives it to the server who gives it to the client.
