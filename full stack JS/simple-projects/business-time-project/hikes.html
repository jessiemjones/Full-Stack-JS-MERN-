        <h1>GREAT HIKES</h1>    
    </div>    
    <p>Zion National Park has a wide range of hiking opportunities ranging from short family-friendly hikes to longer strenuous day hikes and 2 to 3-day backpacking trips. If you are a first-time visitor and want to see the best of Zion in a few days, try to squeeze in all of the best "short-and-easy hikes" below. Fit hikers who are prepared for more strenuous adventures should look into two of Zion's most famous hikes: Angels Landing and the Zion Narrows. Beyond that, there are still many, many more opportunities to explore! Bring the National Geographic Trails Illustrated Map with you to find your way through the different sections of Zion National Park.</p>

        <h2>Emerald Pools</h2>
        <p>Emerald Pools is a Zion classic: an oasis in the middle of the desert. The hike is a collection of short trails that meander past a small, lushly-vegetated stream that rolls down from the cliffs and forms several interesting "pools." If you have only two hours to spend on a leisurely non-strenuous hike with the entire family, I would probably pick this one. As this hike is not very difficult and it is located just across from the Zion Lodge, this trail gets crowded in the summer months. Be prepared to share the views with many other people.</p>

        <h2>Angels Landing</h2>
        <p>Angels Landing is one of the defacto classic hikes in Zion and one of the most stunning viewpoints you will ever experience, but it's not recommended for anybody with a fear of heights. Starting at the Grotto trailhead, the hike to Angels Landing follows the West Rim Trail up and out of the west side of the main canyon. Angels Landing is unique fin-like mountain formation that juts out to the center of the main canyon. The trail follows the narrow spine to the final viewpoint roughly 1500 feet above the canyon floor. Along the way, chains, handrails, and steps reassure hikers at the more exposed sections.</p>

        <h2>Hidden Canyon</h2>
        <p>Hidden Canyon gives hikers a taste of canyoneering without requiring any climbing or rappelling to complete the hike. Starting at the Weeping Rock trailhead, hike up the same trail to Observation Point, but take the side trail to Hidden Canyon instead. The somewhat exposed route will lead you to the mouth of Hidden Canyon -- a beautifully narrow canyon "hidden" above the main canyon. The trail officially ends at the mouth of the canyon, but you can explore quite a ways back.</p>
